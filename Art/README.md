# The Art

`Art.cc` is the program entry point; `GLOutput.cc` sets up the GLFW windows (basically, preps for the OpenGL part of the program),
`Notes.cc` is for printing warnings in the terminal, and `Art.hh` declares all of the GL and general functions/variables/etc.

`PushRelabel.hh` defines the `PushRelabelNetwork` class, and `PushRelabel.cc` has its implementation.
