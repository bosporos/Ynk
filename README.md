# Ynk

Max's stock C++ library.

Atm, to build, you need the following:

    clang (preferably 8+, not sure if compiles on <8)
    a Unix system (pref. macOS, if not, then open an issue/send me an e-mail and I'll make support)
    ninja
    OpenGL + GLUT (if your on macOS, you don't need to do anything)

If you're reading through the code, then check STRUCTURE.md for details. If you
see any other `.md` files, then those are documentation files, and might be worth reading.
