# Structure of the project

Everything relevant to the algorithm and the generative art itself will be in the
`art` directory; the `Ynk` directory is a mix of C++ framing magic, utilities,
ease-of-use support, and other things.

I will stress that it is not necessary to understand anything in the `Ynk` directories;
some of the technologies there are not actually used by the project, or perform
wizardry not relevant to the generative art itself.

A guide to walking through the Art source can be found [here](https://github.com/bosporos/Ynk/blob/master/Art/README.md).
